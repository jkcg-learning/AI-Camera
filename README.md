# Key features
- Neural Inference (object detection, image classification, semantic segmentation, pose estimation)

- Object tracking

- 3D Object Tracking (up to 20 objects with unique ID)

- 3D Object Localization

- H.264 & H.265 Encoding (HEVC, 1080P, and 4K Video) - A Pi Zero can record 4K/30 FPS video with this

- Motion Estimation (allows real-time background subtraction)

- Feature Tracking (optical, and visual inertial navigation)

- Corner Detection

- Stereo Depth (including median filtering, extended disparity and subpixel possible for wider dynamic range)

- Warp/Dewarp - support for additional lenses for fish-eye applications

- JPEG Encoding

- MJPEG Encoding for easy web streaming

- Compatible with most of OAK-D features

- Enclosure compatible with standard tripod mount (1/4”-20)

- Support for on-board stereo and RGB camera modules

- USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C
